        Candidates from TUP Manila, TUP  Taguig, TUP Cavite, and TUP Visayas gathered 
        at the TUP Cavite Campus to receive their official sashes and participated in 
        the tree planting activity last November 27, 2025. The activity themed 
        “Tree Planting and Sashing Ceremony: Blooming the Wisdom of Sustainable 
        Development and Climate Justice,” served as the official introduction of 
        each candidate who will race for the Mr. & Ms. TUP System 2025 crowns.
      </p>

      <p>
        TUP Cavite USG President, John Mars Soriano, officially opened the ceremony with 
        his welcoming remarks, encouraging the candidates to let their advocacies shine. 
        Afterwards, College Secretary of College of Science Dr. Mary Sheenalyn Rodil 
        shared a message, emphasizing the importance of environmental stewardship which 
        was read by John Nathan Baltezar, the event’s Vice Chairperson, on her behalf, 
        “Let us make today the day we choose to stand for the Earth, plant for tomorrow, 
        and leave a legacy of life that future generations will thank us for.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As the program continued, Techno Theatro Band serenaded the TUPians with their 
        performance which boosted the energy of the audience. After the intermission, 
        the candidates introduced themselves and their respective colleges and campuses. 
        VPAA Ryan Reyes led the sashing of the candidates. They also took the Oath of 
        Environmental Protection symbolizing their pledge as a sign of their dedication 
        in preserving and protecting the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. & Ms. TUP System 2025 Chairperson and TUPM USG Vice President Carvin James 
        Galvez concluded the ceremony with a reminder that caring for the environment 
        goes beyond the crowns and sashes. Right after the sashing ceremony, the 
        candidates were given a chance to plant their own tree seedlings beside the 
        TUP Cavite Library which reflects this year’s Mr & Ms. TUP System shared 
        mission: to plant not just trees, but hope, purpose, and long-term 
        commitment to sustainability.
